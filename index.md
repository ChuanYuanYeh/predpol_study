title: A Dive Into How Predictive Policing Works and its Effectiveness
description: A Dive Into How Predictive Policing Works and its Effectiveness

## Overview
As many cities move toward using machine learning in their policing systems, we want to explore how these systems affect the people being policed. Several cities have implemented the use of predictive policing algorithms including New York City NY and Santa Cruz CA. The models built for ‘predictive policing’ claim to have reduced crime and increased efficiency in police resources. These claims have led us to  investigate the question:  “How is predictive policing being used and what is the effect on traffic stops?”. 

Our goal is to see if there is a causal effect of reducing crime, and assess possible model bias in PredPol. We will look at data from the LAPD, and although the results cannot necessarily generalize, the structure of the predictive policing algorithms being used is similar: optimizing police resources to deter crime before it happens. 

The LAPD began deploying PredPol in three divisions (Foothill, Southeast, North Hollywood) back in 2013. It was then extended to all 21 divisions in 2015 as shown in the map below.

We will proceed by looking at how trends in traffic/pedestrian stops, crimes, and arrests have changed since PredPol was deployed.
